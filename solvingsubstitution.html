        <h2>Cryptography Basics: Solving for Substitution</h2>
        <p>
          When dealing with a substitution cipher, you’re looking at replacing each letter of the alphabet with another symbol or character. Solving these types of ciphers can be a fun puzzle, but it requires a methodical approach.
        </p>

        <h3>Tips for Solving Substitution Ciphers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Single-Letter Words:</strong> Look for single-letter words. These are almost always “A” or “I.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Letter Frequency:</strong> Count how often each symbol appears in the cipher. The most frequent symbol is probably “E,” but it could also be “T,” “A,” or “O,” especially in shorter cryptograms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Guesswork:</strong> Pencil in your guesses over the ciphertext. Do you start to see word fragments forming? Be ready to erase and make changes as you go along.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Apostrophes:</strong> Look for apostrophes, which are generally followed by “S,” “T,” “D,” “M,” “LL,” or “RE.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repeating Patterns:</strong> Keep an eye out for common letter groups like “TH,” “SH,” “RE,” “CH,” “TR,” “ING,” “ION,” and “ENT.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Two-Letter Words:</strong> These usually contain one vowel and one consonant. The most common two-letter words, in order of frequency, are “OF,” “TO,” “IN,” “IS,” and “IT.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Three-Letter Words:</strong> The most frequent three-letter words are “THE,” “AND,” “FOR,” “WAS,” and “HIS.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Four-Letter Words:</strong> “THAT” is the most common four-letter word. An encrypted word with the pattern “1 - - 1” is likely “THAT,” but remember that it could also represent 30 other possibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Double Letters:</strong> Double letters are likely to be “LL,” followed by “EE,” “SS,” “OO,” and “TT.” Less frequent double letters can also appear, so keep an open mind.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          Solving substitution ciphers requires patience and attention to detail. By applying these tips, you can increase your chances of cracking the code. Start by focusing on letter frequencies and common word patterns, and the solution will gradually reveal itself.
