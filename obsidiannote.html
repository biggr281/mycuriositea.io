        <h2>My Approach to Notekeeping Using Obsidian</h2>
        <p>
          Notekeeping has evolved significantly since my time studying, and frankly, the concept of building a “second brain” is something I find overwhelming. After doing some research, I’ve found a system that works for me and my needs, which I’m sharing in this post.
        </p>

        <h3>Why I Chose Obsidian</h3>
        <p>
          I decided to use <strong>Obsidian</strong> as my notekeeping tool because it supports offline usage, is highly customizable through plugins, and has an innovative way of linking notes. You can download it <a href="https://obsidian.md/">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Using Flameshot for Screenshots</h3>
        <p>
          For screenshots, I use <strong>Flameshot</strong>, which complements my workflow with Obsidian. You can download Flameshot <a href="https://flameshot.org/">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Tagging for Dynamic Note Organization</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of feeling overwhelmed by traditional organizational methods like creating a strict table of contents, I’ve found Obsidian’s tagging feature incredibly helpful. The dynamic structure that tags create allows for organic connections between topics as they develop over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Obsidian, you can use simple tags like <code>#exampletag</code> to categorize notes. Alternatively, using <code>[[LinkToNewPage]]</code> creates a new blank page linked to the subject. Over time, these linked pages can serve as an index, centralizing knowledge in an intuitive way.
        </p>

        <h3>Markdown Essentials in Obsidian</h3>
        <p>
          Obsidian uses basic Markdown, which makes it easy to format notes. Here are some of the key Markdown commands I use:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Header 1:</strong> <code># header</code></li>
          <li><strong>Header 2:</strong> <code>## header</code></li>
          <li><strong>Bulleted Lists:</strong> Just use a dash <code>- </code> to start the list</li>
          <li><strong>Numbered Lists:</strong> Type <code>1. </code> and hit space to start</li>
          <li><strong>Code Blocks:</strong> Use <code>``</code> for inline code, or <code>```language</code> for multiline blocks</li>
          <li><strong>Images/Embeds:</strong> Embed images using <code>![[filename]]</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Folder Structure for Organizing Notes</h3>
        <p>
          When I started using Obsidian, I created a few essential folders to help me stay organized:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Notes</li>
          <li>Logs</li>
          <li>Excalidraw (for diagrams)</li>
          <li>Calendar</li>
          <li>Templates</li>
          <li>Assets</li>
          <li>Export</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These folders keep my files categorized and work seamlessly with my tagging system.
        </p>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          While I’m still growing my system and adapting to these changes, Obsidian offers a powerful yet flexible approach to notekeeping. I’ll revisit this post in the future to share updates as my system evolves. For now, this workflow has made keeping notes more efficient and less overwhelming.
