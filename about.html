            	<h2>Who am I?</h2>

		<p>My name is William Biggar. My background for many years has been in sales and business development. It has given me many opportunities and taken me all over the world. In the past few years, after meeting people from different walks of life, I’ve been working towards something different. Rather than just telling people how they can fix their problems, I want to share why they should and give them the knowledge to do it themselves.</p>

                <p>The people I mentioned above are friends and colleagues who took the time, effort, and heart to educate me, broadening my perspective. Their names appear in the footer of each page, as I am eternally grateful for everything they shared. I hope everyone finds such positive influences in their lives.</p>

                <p>My long-term plan for this website is to share a body of work and catalog the different projects I undertake for personal interest or career development. The name <strong>mycuriositea</strong> was chosen for multiple reasons. Firstly, I have a passion for good tea. Every day, I make an effort to enjoy quiet time, either alone or with friends and family, where we have tea and reflect on life. Secondly, it's a mindful way to practice <em>Gong Fu</em>, which is a driving philosophy of my life.</p>

                <h2>What is Gong Fu?</h2>

                <p><strong>Gong Fu</strong>, in short, means "skill acquired through mindful practice." I first encountered the concept through the tea community in a practice called <strong>GongFuCha</strong>. It's essentially tea time with tiny cups, often accompanied by pouring tea on tiny stone animals, with many vessels being used to brew and serve. While overwhelming at first, it all has meaning.</p>

                <p>In essence, <strong>Gong Fu</strong> symbolizes the difference between a professional chef cutting vegetables and a novice. No matter how much guidance the chef provides—whether it's the sharpest knife, cutting techniques, or other tips—the novice must still put in the thousands of hours of practice. Only with mindful practice can they eventually improve and match the chef's skills.</p>

                <p>This is my goal. I hope that whatever brings you to this website, you leave with something valuable for yourself.</p>

                <p>Thanks for stopping by,<br> William</p>
