                <p>My name is William Biggar. My background for many years has been sales and business development. It’s given me many opportunities and it has taken me all over the world. But during the last several years and after meeting a number of people from different walks of life, I’ve been working towards something different. Instead of telling people how they can fix their problems, I decided I wanted to be able to share with people why they should fix their problems and have the knowledge to teach them how to do so.</p>

                <p>The people that I mentioned in the paragraph above are friends and colleagues that took their time, effort and heart and educated me while broadening my perspective. Their names are in the footnote of each page, because I am eternally grateful for everything they shared. I hope everyone can have people who leave such a positive influence in their life.</p>

                <p>My long-term plan for this website is to share a body of work, and catalog different projects I undertake for personal interest or career development. The reason why I chose the name mycuriositea is for multiple reasons. Firstly, I have a passion for good tea. I like to make an effort every day to enjoy some quiet time either alone or with friends and family where we have tea and reflect on life. The second reason is because it is a mindful way to practice Gong Fu, which is a driving philosophy of my life.</p>

                <p>What is Gong Fu?</p>

                <p>Opening with the tl;dr version, Gong Fu is the “skill acquired through mindful practice”. Initially, I learned about the concept through the tea community with a practice called “GongFuCha”. It’s essentially just tea time with the tiny little cups, you’ll see people throwing out cups of tea instead of drinking them, there are these tiny little stone animals (they also get tea poured on them), with what seems like a dozen vessels being used to pour the tea around. It’s overwhelming, but it all has reasons.</p>

                <p>What Gong Fu represents is the difference between a professional chef cutting vegetables versus the novice. It doesn’t matter what the chef does for the novice, whether it be giving them the sharpest knife, showing them how to cut, or teaching them other techniques. The novice has no choice but to put in the thousands of hours that the chef has. Even then, the novice will only improve and be equal to the chef if they have been mindful during the time that they practiced cutting the vegetables.</p>

                <p>So that is my goal. I hope whatever brings you to this website that you can take something away for yourself.</p>
